# Loop of Posts

This theme came with a plugin that works look like the worpdress loop.
Of couser still is not at the same level but with this you can get every data of the Wp Rest Api in any componet child of your project.

You can use the loop without vue.js too, just get the file in wp-rest folder and include the file GetPosts.js in your progect. It is pure js so will work in the most of projects

But remenber to change  the variable 'siteName' of the file because if you don't get the data with the wordpress files you can't get the loop to worck, just change to 'http://yoursitename//wp-json/wp/v2/' and should resolve this issue.


this is the global function to use the plugin:

`this.\$Get_Posts(args)`

# Examples of use the Loop:

1 - Default Use
`function myCustomDeafultLoop(){
    let args = {
        route: "posts",
        filters: {
        per_page: 5,
        order: 'asc'
    }
    let posts = this.$Get_Posts(args);

see the results in console
console.log(posts);
};
    `


}
}

2 - Using custom Endpoint:

`function myCustomEndpoint(){
    let args = {}
    let endipoint = '';
    let posts = this.$Get_Posts(args, endipoint);

    //see the results in consol
    console.log(posts);
};


}
}
`

## Args

Parameter     | Value
------------- | -------------
route         | **string:** First parameter of endpost: posts,page,pages,catgories,media,etc... [All Parameter Routes](http://www.google.fr/)
per_Page      | **int:** Number of Posts to receve

## EndPoint
This is how is moutend the endPoint of $GetPosts Loop

let endPoint = http://siteName/wp-json/v2/ + route + endline + filters;

So if you wnat you can ignore the filter and routes and use just the endline.

The siteName json is get automaticly by the wp_localize_script();
